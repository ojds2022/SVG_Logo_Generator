Users must first create a package.json file. For package management, npm is used. Users can run 'npm i' in the terminal to install all dependencies. 

## Usage
This app is used in the command terminal. Users can initiate the app by first entering 'node index.js' in the command line. Next, users will be given a series of questions regarding how they would like to style their SVG logo. Once all questions are answered, a customized SVG logo will automatically be created.
